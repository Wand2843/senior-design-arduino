This is the main repository for all of the code which applies to our project.

Here is an introduction on how to clone this repository and update/pull the changes respectively:

Cloning an existing Git repository allows you to copy all the files and history of a project from a remote location (such as GitHub) to your local machine. Here are the basic steps to clone a repository:

Make sure you have Git installed on your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository.
Use the command "git clone" followed by the repository's URL. For example, if the repository is on GitHub, the URL will be in the format "https://github.com/username/repositoryname.git"
Press Enter. This will download all the files and history of the repository to your local machine.
The repository will be cloned in a new folder, which will have the same name as the repository in the remote.
Once you have cloned a repository, you can make changes to the code, commit them, and even push the changes back to the remote repository.
It's also important to note that a cloned repository will be connected to the remote and you can always pull the updates from the remote repository using "git pull" command.

These are the basic steps to clone a repository. There are also advanced options such as specifying a different branch or directory to clone the repository to.
